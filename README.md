gitsubmodule
------------
This is a small script I wrote to help me in some of the common `git submodule` operations that I find either hard or long
* git submodule update : doesn't pull the latest submodule as I expect it to do.
* git submodule remove : isn't there and every time I try to do it, I have to google how.
